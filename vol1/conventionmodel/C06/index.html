                  <h1>Chapter VI - Special Provisions</h1>
                
                <p>SPECIAL PROVISIONSNon-discrimination1.  Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="">Article 1</a>, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.</p>
<p>2.  Stateless persons who are residents of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in either Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of the State concerned in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.</p>
<p>3.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.</p>
<p>4.  Except where the provisions of <a href="">paragraph 1</a> of Article 9, <a href="">paragraph 6</a> of Article 11, or <a href="">paragraph 4</a> of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Similarly, any debts of an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable capital of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been contracted to a resident of the first-mentioned State.</p>
<p>5.  Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.</p>
<p>6.  The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of <a href="">Article 2</a>, apply to taxes of every kind and description.</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 1</a>Amended on 23 July 1992, by adding the words “in particular with respect to residence” in the first sentence, by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 1 read as follows:“1.  Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 1 was previously amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977, notably by adding the second sentence. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 1 read as follows:“1.  The nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 2</a>Amended on 23 October 1997 by adding the words “in particular with respect to residence” after the words “in the same circumstances” by the report entitled “The 1997 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 October 1997. After 23 July 1992 and until 23 October 1997, paragraph 2 read as follows:“2.  Stateless persons who are residents of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in either Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of the State concerned in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 as it read after 23 July 1992 corresponded to paragraph 3 of the 1977 Model Convention. On 23 July 1992 paragraph 2 of the 1977 Model Convention was amended and redesignated as subparagraph 1 <em>f)</em> of Article 3 (see history of paragraph 1 of Article 3) and paragraph 3 was renumbered as paragraph 2 by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 23 July 1992, paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  The term “nationals” means:all individuals possessing the nationality of a Contracting State;</p>
<p>all legal persons, partnerships and associations deriving their status as such from the laws in force in a Contracting State.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  Stateless persons shall not be subjected in a Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 3</a>Corresponds to paragraph 4 of the 1977 Model Convention as it read before 23 July 1992. On that date paragraph 3 was renumbered as paragraph 2 (see history of paragraph 2) and paragraph 4 of the 1977 Model Convention was renumbered as paragraph 3 by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 was amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention, the second sentence was presented as a second paragraph within paragraph 4 of the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963). This was corrected when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted.</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 4</a>Corresponds to paragraph 5 of the 1977 Model Convention as it read before 23 July 1992. On that date paragraph 4 was renumbered as paragraph 3 (see history of paragraph 3) and paragraph 5 of the 1977 Model Convention was renumbered as paragraph 4 by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992.</p>
<p>Paragraph 5 of the 1977 Model Convention was added when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977.</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 5</a>Corresponds to paragraph 6 of the 1977 Model Convention as it read before 23 July 1992. On that date paragraph 5 was renumbered as paragraph 4 (see history of paragraph 4) and paragraph 6 of the 1977 Model Convention was renumbered as paragraph 5 by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992.</p>
<p>Paragraph 6 of the 1977 Model Convention corresponded to paragraph 5 of the 1963 Draft Convention. Paragraph 5 of the 1963 Draft Convention was renumbered as paragraph 6 and amended when the 1977 Model Convention, was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 5 read as follows:“5.  Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of that first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 6</a>Corresponds to paragraph 7 of the 1977 Model Convention as it read before 23 July 1992. On that date paragraph 6 was renumbered as paragraph 5 (see history of paragraph 5) and paragraph 7 of the 1977 Model Convention was renumbered as paragraph 6 by the report entitled “The Revision of the Model Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 23 July 1992.</p>
<p>Paragraph 7 of the 1977 Model Convention corresponded to paragraph 6 of the 1963 Draft Convention. Paragraph 6 of the 1963 Draft Convention was amended and renumbered as paragraph 7 when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 6 read as follows:“6.  In this Article the term “taxation” means taxes of every kind and description.”</p>
<p>Mutual agreement procedure1.  Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident or, if his case comes under <a href="">paragraph 1</a> of Article 24, to that of the Contracting State of which he is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.</p>
<p>2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.</p>
<p>3.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.</p>
<p>4.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly, including through a joint commission consisting of themselves or their representatives, for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.</p>
<p>5.  Where,under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and</p>
<p>the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within two years from the presentation of the case to the competent authority of the other Contracting State,</p>
<p>any unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of either State. Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph.1</p>
<p>1  In some States, national law, policy or administrative considerations may not allow or justify the type of dispute resolution envisaged under this paragraph. In addition, some States may only wish to include this paragraph in treaties with certain States. For these reasons, the paragraph should only be included in the Convention where each State concludes that it would be appropriate to do so based on the factors described in <a href="">paragraph 65</a> of the Commentary on the paragraph. As mentioned in <a href="">paragraph 74</a> of that Commentary, however, other States may be able to agree to remove from the paragraph the condition that issues may not be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been rendered by one of their courts or administrative tribunals.</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 1</a>Amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977 notably by adding the second sentence.

Where a resident of a Contracting State considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with this Convention, he may, notwithstanding the remedies provided by the national laws of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 2</a>Amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977 notably by adding the second sentence. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 2 read as follows:“2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at an appropriate solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with the Convention.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 3</a>Unchanged since the adoption of the 1963 Draft Convention by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963.</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 4</a>Amended on 21 September 1995 by the report entitled “The 1995 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 21 September 1995.

When it seems advisable in order to reach agreement to have an oral exchange of opinions, such exchange may take place through a Commission consisting of representatives of the competent authorities of the Contracting States.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 5</a>Added on 17 July 2008 by the report entitled “The 2008 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 17 July 2008.</p>
<p>Exchange of information1.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles <a href="">1</a> and <a href="">2</a>.</p>
<p>2.  Any information received under <a href="">paragraph 1</a> by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.</p>
<p>3.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs <a href="">1</a> and <a href="">2</a> be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;</p>
<p>to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;</p>
<p>to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).</p>
<p>4.  If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of <a href="">paragraph 3</a> but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.</p>
<p>5.  In no case shall the provisions of <a href="">paragraph 3</a> be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.</p>

<p><a href="">Paragraph 5</a>Added on 15 July 2005 by the report entitled “The 2005 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 15 July 2005, on the basis of another report entitled “Changes to Articles 25 and 26 of the Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 1 June 2004).</p>
<p>Assistance in the collection of taxes<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">1</a></sup> 1.  The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Articles <a href="">1</a> and <a href="">2</a>. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article.</p>
<p>2.  The term “revenue claim” as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount.</p>
<p>3.  When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State.</p>
<p>4.  When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection.</p>
<p>5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of <a href="">paragraph 3</a> or <a href="">4</a> shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of <a href="">paragraph 3</a> or <a href="">4</a> shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State.</p>
<p>6.  Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State.</p>
<p>7.  Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under <a href="">paragraph 3</a> or <a href="">4</a> and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to bein the case of a request under <a href="">paragraph 3</a>, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, or</p>
<p>in the case of a request under <a href="">paragraph 4</a>, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection</p>
<p>the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request.</p>
<p>8.  In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;</p>
<p>to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public);</p>
<p>to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice;</p>
<p>to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State.</p>

<p>2.  Unless otherwise agreed by both Contracting States, the termination of the Convention by one of them under <a href="">Article 30</a> shall also terminate, in the manner provided for in that Article, the application of the Convention [to any part of the territory of (State A) or of (State B) or] to any State or territory to which it has been extended under this Article.</p>
<p>1 The words between brackets are of relevance when, by special provision, a part of the territory of a Contracting State is excluded from the application of the Convention.</p>
<p>Article 29 corresponds to Article 28 as it read before 28 January 2003 when it was renumbered as Article 29.
