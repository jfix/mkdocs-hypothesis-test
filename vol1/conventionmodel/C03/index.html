                  <h1>Chapter III - Taxation of Income</h1>
                
                <p>TAXATION OF INCOMEIncome from immovable property1.  Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.</p>
<p>2.  The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.</p>
<p>3.  The provisions of <a href="">paragraph 1</a> shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property.</p>
<p>4.  The provisions of  <a href="">Paragraph 1</a> and <a href="">3</a> shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise.</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 1</a>Amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 1 read as follows:“1.  Income from immovable property may be taxed in the Contracting State in which such property is situated.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 2</a>Amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977, by changing the first sentence. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 2 read as follows:“2.  The term “immovable property” shall be defined in accordance with the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 3</a>Unchanged since the adoption of the 1963 Draft Convention by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963.</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 4</a>Amended on 29 April 2000 by the report entitled “The 2000 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 29 April 2000, on the basis of the Annex of another report entitled “Issues related to Article 14 of the OECD Model Tax Convention” (adopted by the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs on 27 January 2000). In the 1977 Convention and until 29 April 2000, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 was previously amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977, by substituting the words “independent personal services” for “professional services”. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of professional services.”</p>
<p>Business profits1.  Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits that are attributable to the permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 may be taxed in that other State.</p>
<p>2.  For the purposes of this Article and Article [23 A] [23 B], the profits that are attributable in each Contracting State to the permanent establishment referred to in paragraph 1 are the profits it might be expected to make, in particular in its dealings with other parts of the enterprise, if it were a separate and independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, taking into account the functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the permanent establishment and through the other parts of the enterprise.</p>
<p>3.  Where, in accordance with paragraph 2, a Contracting State adjusts the profits that are attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States and taxes accordingly profits of the enterprise that have been charged to tax in the other State, the other State shall, to the extent necessary to eliminate double taxation on these profits, make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged on those profits. In determining such adjustment, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.</p>
<p>4.  Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 1</a>Amended on 22 July 2010 by the report entitled “The 2010 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 22 July 2010. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until 22 July 2010, paragraph 1 read as follows:“1.  The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 2</a>Replaced on 22 July 2010 when paragraph 2 was deleted and a new paragraph 2 was added by the report entitled “The 2010 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 22 July 2010. In the 1977 Model Convention and until it was deleted on 22 July 2010 paragraph 2 read as follows:“2.  Subject to the provisions of <a href="">paragraph 3</a>, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 was amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977, by adding the words “Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3” at the beginning of the paragraph. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 2 read as follows:“2.  Where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 3</a>Replaced on 22 July 2010 when paragraph 2 was deleted and a new paragraph 2 was added by the report entitled “The 2010 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 22 July 2010. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 22 July 2010 paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 3 was amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977, by substituting the words “In determining” for “In the determination of” at the beginning of the paragraph. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 3 read as follows:“3.  In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 4</a>Corresponds to paragraph 7 as it read before 22 July 2010. On that date paragraph 4, was deleted and paragraph 7 was renumbered as paragraph 4 by the report entitled the “2010 Update to the Model Tax Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 22 July 2010.</p>
<p>Paragraph 7, as it read before 22 July 2010 was included in the 1963 Draft Convention, adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 of the 1977 Model Convention was deleted on 22 July 2010 by the report entitled the “2010 Update to the Model Tax Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 22 July 2010. In the 1977 Model tax Convention and until 22 July 2010, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in <a href="">paragraph 2</a> shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 4 was amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977, by substituting the word “contained” in the last line for “laid down”. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 4 read as follows:“4.  Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles laid down in this Article.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph</a>Deleted on 22 July 2010 by the report entitled “The 2010 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 22 July 2010. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until 22 July 2010 paragraph 5 read as follows:“5.  No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph</a>Deleted on 22 July 2010 by the report entitled “The 2010 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 22 July 2010. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until 22 July 2010 paragraph 6 read as follows:“6.  For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph</a>Renumbered on 22 July 2010 as paragraph 4 (see history of paragraph 4) by the report entitled the “2010 Update to the Model Tax Convention” adopted by the OECD Council on 22 July 2010.</p>

The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 was added when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977.</p>
