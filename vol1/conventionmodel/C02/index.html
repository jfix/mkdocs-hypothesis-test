As regards the application of the Convention by a Contracting State any term not otherwise defined shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning which it has under the laws of that Contracting State relating to the taxes which are the subject of the Convention.”</p>
<p>Resident1.  For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or capital situated therein.</p>
<p>2.  Where by reason of the provisions of <a href="">paragraph 1</a> an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows:he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests);</p>
<p>if the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has an habitual abode;</p>
<p>if he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which he is a national;</p>
<p>if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>3.  Where by reason of the provisions of <a href="">paragraph 1</a> a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is situated.</p>
<p><strong>The title of Article 4:</strong>Changed when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, the title of Article 4 as follows:“FISCAL DOMICILE”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 1</a>Amended on 21 September 1995, by adding to the first sentence the words “and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof” and by replacing in the second sentence the words “But this term” with “This term, however,”, by the report entitled “The 1995 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 21 September 1995. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 21 September 1995, paragraph 1 read as follows:“1.  For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature. But this term does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or capital situated therein.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 1 was previously amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977, by the addition of the second sentence. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 1 read as follows:“1.  For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the law of that State, is liable to taxation therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature.”</p>
<p><a href="">Paragraph 2</a>Amended on 23 October 1997, by adding the word “only” after the word “resident” in the third line of subparagraph <em>a)</em> to correct an omission that was made when similar changes were made to subparagraphs <em>a)</em>, <em>b)</em> and <em>c)</em> as part of the 1995 update (see below), by the report entitled “The 1997 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 23 October 1997.

<p>Subparagraphs <em>a)</em>, <em>b)</em>, and <em>c)</em> were previously amended on 21 September 1995, by adding the word “only” after the word “resident” (except in the third line of subparagraph <em>a)</em>), by the report entitled “The 1995 Update to the Model Tax Convention”, adopted by the OECD Council on 21 September 1995. In the 1977 Model Convention and until 21 September 1995, paragraph 2 read as follows:“2.  Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows:he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests);</p>
<p>if the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has an habitual abode;</p>
<p>if he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State of which he is a national;</p>
<p>if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement.”</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 was previously amended when the 1977 Model Convention was adopted by the OECD Council on 11 April 1977. In the 1963 Draft Convention (adopted by the OECD Council on 30 July 1963) and until the adoption of the 1977 Model Convention, paragraph 2 read as follows:“2.  Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then this case shall be determined in accordance with the following rules:He shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State in which he has a permanent home available to him. If he has a permanent home available to him in both Contracting States, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State with which his personal and economic relations are closest (centre of vital interests);</p>

<p>5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs <a href="">1</a> and <a href="">2</a>, where a person — other than an agent of an independent status to whom <a href="">paragraph 6</a>applies — is acting on behalf of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in <a href="">paragraph 4</a>which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.</p>
<p>6.  An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.</p>
<p>7.  The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.</p>
