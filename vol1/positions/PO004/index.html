<p>Paragraph 11.  Albania,Armenia,Azerbaijan,Belarus,Bulgaria,Colombia,Indonesia,Latvia,Lithuania,Russia,Thailand,UkraineandVietnamreserve the right to include the place of incorporation or a similar criterion (registration for Belarus and Vietnam) in <a href="">paragraph 1</a>.<a href="">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>

<p>2.1  Hong Kong, Chinareserves the right to modify the definition of “resident” in its bilateral agreements because it is not a sovereign state and it taxes on a territorial basis.<a href="">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>3.  Brazilreserves the right not to include the second sentence of <a href="">paragraph 1</a> in its conventions as the position of diplomatic staff is dealt with under its domestic law.<a href="">(Added on 23 October 1997 see History)</a></p>
<p>3.1  MalaysiaandSingaporereserve the right not to include the second sentence of <a href="">paragraph 1</a> in their agreements.<a href="">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.  IndiaandRussiareserve the right to amend the Article in their tax conventions in order to specify that their partnerships must be considered as residents of their respective countries in view of their legal and tax characteristics.<a href="">(Amended on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.1  Gabon,Ivory Coast,MoroccoandTunisiado not agree with the general principle according to which if tax owed by a partnership is determined on the basis of the personal characteristics of the partners, these partners are entitled to the benefits of tax conventions entered into by the States of which they are residents as regards income that “flows through” that partnership. Under their domestic law, a partnership is considered to be liable to tax even though, technically, that tax is collected from the partners or in the case of Morocco from the principal partner; for that reason, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Morocco and Tunisia reserve the right to amend the Article in their tax conventions in order to specify that their partnerships must be considered as residents of their country in view of their legal and tax characteristics.<a href="">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>4.2  <a href="">(Deleted on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>Paragraph 35.  Armenia,Bulgaria,Russia,ThailandandVietnamreserve the right to use the place of incorporation (registration for Vietnam) as the test for <a href="">paragraph 3</a>.<a href="">(Amended on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>6.  Azerbaijanreserves the right to use either “registration (incorporation)” or “place of effective management” as the criterion for determining the residence of a person in <a href="">paragraph 3</a>.<a href="">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>7.  Argentinareserves the right to use a place of incorporation test for determining the residence of a company and, failing that, to deny dual resident companies benefits under the Convention.<a href="">(Replaced on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>8.  India,KazakhstanandSingaporereserve the right to include a provision that will refer to a mutual agreement procedure for determination of the country of residence in case of a dual resident person other than an individual if the State in which its effective place of management is situated cannot be determined.<a href="">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>8.1  Bulgariareserves the right to include a provision that will refer to the State of derivation of the legal status and, in case this State could not be determined, to the mutual agreement procedure, for the determination of the country of residence in the case of a dual resident person other than an individual and a company and, in the absence of such an agreement, it will deny benefits under the Convention to this person.<a href="">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>8.2  Colombiareserves the right to deny benefits under the Convention to dual resident persons other than individuals.<a href="">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>Paragraph 29.  In the opinion ofVietnamthe personal relations and economic relations mentioned in <a href="">XREFSTYLE=ParaLabelPlural</a> and <a href="">15</a> of the Commentary should be separated and one given priority over the other. For Vietnam, economic relations, particularly the criterion of the country where employment is exercised, is more important to determine the country of residence for treaty purposes in the case of a dual resident individual.<a href="">(Added on 23 October 1997 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.1  In the case ofGabon, since the phrase “and economic relations” used in <a href="">XREFSTYLE=ParaLabelPlural</a>, <a href="">14</a> and <a href="">15</a> of the Commentary is ambiguous, these two types of relations should be distinguished and one type may have priority over the other. The State in which employment is exercised should therefore prevail over the personal relations for purposes of determining the State of residence of an individual.<a href="">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.2  Kazakhstanreserves the right to replace <a href="">XREFSTYLE=subpara</a> <em><em> </em>d</em>) by: “<em>d)</em> if the individual’s status cannot be determined by reason of subparagraphs <em>a)</em> to <em>c)</em> of this paragraph, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement.”<a href="">(Added on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.3  Indonesiais of the opinion that in considering the dual residence of an individual, economic relations shall have priority over personal relations.<a href="">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>9.4  Singaporereserves the right to replace subparagraph <em>d</em>) by: “<em>d</em>) in any other case, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement.”<a href="">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>Paragraph 310.  The interpretation byArgentina,Armenia,Bulgaria, Russia,UkraineandVietnamof the term “place of effective management” is practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.<a href="">(Amended on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>11.  Indiadoes not adhere to the interpretation given in <a href="">paragraph 24</a> that the place of effective management is the place where key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the entity’s business as a whole are in substance made. It is of the view that the place where the main and substantial activity of the entity is carried on is also to be taken into account when determining the place of effective management.<a href="">(Added on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>12.  Brazildoes not adhere to the interpretation given in <a href="">paragraph 24</a> of the Commentary since it considers that such definition is an issue to be dealt with by domestic law and domestic court decisions.<a href="">(Added on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
