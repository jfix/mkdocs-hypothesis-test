<p>11.  With respect to paragraph 11,Chileis of the view that the Commentary to the OECD Model Convention is an important reference for the Chilean Tax authority when interpreting Chilean treaties with equal or similar wording to the Model. When interpreting a particular treaty, however, the view held by the Tax authority is that only that edition of the Commentary which was applicable at the time of the treaty’s completion can be used as guidance. A newer Commentary that is merely clarifying what had been the correctly understood meaning should in this context be distinguished from wording that attempts to alter the previous meaning of the Commentary.”</p>
