<p>13.  Argentina,Morocco,SerbiaandTunisiado not adhere to the interpretation in <a href="">XREFSTYLE=ParaLabelPlural</a> and <a href="">15</a> of the Commentary. They hold the view that payments relating to software fall within the scope of the Article where less than the full rights to software are transferred, either if the payments are in consideration for the right to use a copyright on software for commercial exploitation or if they relate to software acquired for the personal or business use of the purchaser.<a href="">(Amended on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>14.  Vietnamdoes not agree with <a href="">paragraph 9</a> of the Commentary.

<p>16.  Malaysiacannot adhere to the new additional sentence in <a href="">paragraph 11.2</a>,i.e.“Payments made under the latter contracts generally fall under <a href="">Article 7</a>”. Malaysia treats payments for the provision of services as Special Classes of Income under her domestic law and not as business income.<a href="">(Added on 28 January 2003 see History)</a></p>
<p>17.  Indiareserves its position on the interpretations provided in paragraphs <a href="">8.2</a>, <a href="">10.1</a>, <a href="">10.2</a>, <a href="">14</a>, <a href="">14.1</a>, <a href="">14.2</a>, <a href="">14.4</a>, <a href="">15</a>, <a href="">16</a> and <a href="">17.3</a>; it is of the view that some of the payments referred to may constitute royalties.<a href="">(Added on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>17.1  Colombiadoes not adhere to the interpretations provided in paragraphs <a href="">8.2</a>, <a href="">13.1</a>, <a href="">14</a>, <a href="">14.1</a>, <a href="">14.2</a>, <a href="">14.4</a>, <a href="">15</a>, <a href="">16</a> and <a href="">17.3</a>; under its tax laws some of the payments referred to may constitute royalties.<a href="">(Added on 15 July 2014 see History)</a></p>
<p>18.  Indiadoes not agree with the interpretation that information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience is confined to only previous experience.<a href="">(Added on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>19.  Malaysiadoes not adhere to the interpretation in paragraph 14.2 because Malaysia is of the view that licence fees for rights to distribute software constitute royalties.<a href="">(Added on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>20.  Indiadoes not agree with the interpretation in <a href="">paragraph 9.1</a> of the Commentary on Article 12 according to which a payment for transponder leasing will not constitute royalty. This notion is contrary to the Indian position that income from transponder leasing constitutes an equipment royalty taxable both under India’s domestic law and its treaties with many countries. It is also contrary to India’s position that a payment for the use of a transponder is a payment for the use of a process resulting in a royalty under <a href="">Article 12</a>. India also does not agree with the conclusion included in the paragraph concerning undersea cables and pipelines as it considers that undersea cables and pipelines are industrial, commercial or scientific equipment and that payments made for their use constitute equipment royalties.<a href="">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>21.  Indiadoes not agree with the interpretation in <a href="">paragraph 9.2</a> of the Commentary on Article 12. It considers that a roaming call constitutes the use of a process. Accordingly, the payment made for the use of that process constitutes a royalty for the purposes of <a href="">Article 12</a>. It is also the position of India that a payment for a roaming call constitutes a royalty since it is a payment for the use of industrial, commercial or scientific equipment.<a href="">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>22.  Indiadoes not agree with the interpretation in <a href="">paragraph 9.3</a> of the Commentary on Article 12. It considers that a payment for spectrum license constitutes a royalty taxable both under India’s domestic law and its treaties with many countries.<a href="">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
<p>23.
