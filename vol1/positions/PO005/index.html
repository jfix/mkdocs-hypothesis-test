<p>37.  Indiadoes not agree with the interpretation given in <a href="">paragraph 42.19</a> that only the profits derived from services should be taxed and the provisions that are included in bilateral Conventions which allow a State to tax the gross amount of the fees paid for certain services is not an appropriate way of taxing services.<a href="">(Added on 17 July 2008 see History)</a></p>
<p>38.

<p>43.  Indiadoes not agree with the interpretation in <a href="">paragraph 5.5</a> of the Commentary on Article 5 according to which a satellite’s footprint in the space of a source country cannot be treated as a permanent establishment. India is of the view that in such a case, the source state not only contributes its customer base but also provides infrastructure for reception of the satellite telecast or telecommunication process. India is also of the view that a satellite’s footprint falls both in the international and national space. The footprint has a fixed location, has a value and can be used for commercial purposes. Accordingly, it can be treated as a fixed place of business in the space in the jurisdiction of a source country.<a href="">(Added on 22 July 2010 see History)</a></p>
